# Chat Backup

Exports WhatsApp messages from your Mac into a beautiful, browsable HTML viewer
with inline voice messages, images, and video — themed after heartkemy.art.

Also picks up iPhone exports from WhatsApp's "Export Chat" feature.

## Quick Start

```bash
./run.sh
```

Open http://localhost:8765

## How It Runs

The viewer server and hourly sync run through launchd:

| Job | What it does |
|-----|-------------|
| `com.chatbackup.server` | Serves the viewer on `127.0.0.1:8765`. `KeepAlive` — auto-restarts on crash and at login. |
| `com.chatbackup.sync` | Opens the signed headless `ChatBackupSync.app` every hour and at login. |

The sync app is an `LSUIElement` agent, so it runs without a Dock icon or
Terminal window. Its stable signed bundle identity and the launch plist's
`AssociatedBundleIdentifiers` entry keep macOS privacy grants attached to the
same responsible process. Do not rebuild or ad-hoc re-sign the app, and never
replace this path with a Terminal-owned scheduled command.

### One-time macOS approval

If macOS asks again, re-enable the existing `ChatBackupSync.app` in **System
Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access**. The historical signed app
expects `/opt/homebrew/bin/sigtop`; the installer maintains that path as a
compatibility symlink to `~/.local/bin/sigtop`.

Run `./scripts/install-sync-agent.sh` to repair the job and
`./scripts/check-sync-agent.sh` to verify the no-Terminal invariant. See
[`docs/scheduled-sync.md`](docs/scheduled-sync.md) for the exact recovery path.

Operational checks must use counts, hashes, timestamps, and exit state only;
do not print archive contents.

RAM/CPU: negligible — the builder runs briefly once per hour.


## What It Backs Up

| Source | Messages | Voice Messages | Automatic? |
|--------|----------|---------------|------------|
| WhatsApp (Mac app) | ✅ | ✅ (if cached locally) | ✅ Every hour |
| WhatsApp (iPhone export) | ✅ | ✅ (all of them) | When you add a zip |
| Signal Desktop | ✅ | ✅ (if cached locally) | ✅ Every hour |

WhatsApp voice messages from the Mac app are limited — the app only caches audio
files it has played locally. For a **complete backup with all voice messages**,
use your iPhone: open a chat → tap the contact name → **Export Chat** (with media).
Place the resulting `.zip` in `~/Downloads/WhatsApp Chat - Name.zip` and it'll be
picked up on the next run (or run `./run.sh` manually).

## How It Works

1. **WhatsApp (Mac)** — reads `ChatStorage.sqlite` from the macOS Catalyst app's
   sandbox at `~/Library/Group Containers/group.net.whatsapp.WhatsApp.shared/`.
   The database is unencrypted SQLite with CoreData schema.
2. **WhatsApp (iPhone)** — parses WhatsApp's standard `_chat.txt` export format
   and extracts all media files (including `.opus` voice messages).
3. **HTML Viewer** — generates a single-page dark-themed chat browser with:
   - Search by conversation name
   - Day dividers between messages
   - Inline audio/video/image playback
   - Image lightbox
   - Gradient heartkemy theme

All media files are copied into the output directory — no external dependencies
at runtime.

## Development

### Dependencies

- Python 3
- Standard library only (no pip packages needed)

### Building

```bash
python3 chat_backup/builder.py
```

Output goes to `data/` (override with `$CHAT_BACKUP_DIR`).

### Serving Locally

```bash
cd data && python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Or just use `./run.sh` which does both.

### Signal Export

Signal Desktop encrypts its database key in the macOS Keychain. The keychain
approval was granted once for the `sigtop` tool, and macOS caches it — so the
hourly sync exports Signal automatically, silently, with no prompts.

Note: Signal Desktop only syncs messages to this Mac while the app is open.
If Signal Desktop hasn't been run in a while, the export reflects the last
time it was open. Open Signal Desktop occasionally to keep the archive fresh.

### Adding iPhone Exports

Drop WhatsApp export zips in `~/Downloads/` with the original naming convention:
`WhatsApp Chat - Name.zip`. The builder finds them automatically by filename.

## Cron / Automation

The hourly sync is installed as a launchd agent:

```bash
# Install (already done):
cp cron/com.chatbackup.sync.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.chatbackup.sync.plist

# View redacted operational logs:
tail -f ~/__code__/chat_backup/cron/sync.log

# Uninstall:
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/com.chatbackup.sync
```

The server at `:8080` survives restarts — the cron job checks if it's running
and starts it if not.


## Design

Themes after [heartkemy.art](https://heartkemy.art) — dark warm background
(`#221a16`), ivory text (`#fff3e3`), alchemical gradient accents
(purple → orange → yellow). Fonts: Outfit (UI) + Bitter (serif accents).
